    <h1>An Example Article</h1>

    <h2>Some Equations You May Have Heard Of</h2>
    Have you heard of the plank equation $E = \hbar\omega$?

    How about this one?
    \begin{equation}
      E = \gamma m c^2 \ge 0
    \end{equation}

    Or this one?
    \begin{equation}
      s(\k,t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} { \rho( \x, t ) e^{-i2\pi \k \cdot \x } d\x }
    \end{equation}

    <h2>How About a Theorem and Definition?</h2>
    Heres a theorem:
    <div class="theorem">
        There are no natural numbers
        $\natural = (1, 2, 3, \ldots)$
        $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that
        $x^n + y^n = z^n$, in which $n$
        is a natural number greater than 2.
    </div>
    <div class="definition">
        A set $C$ is <i>convex</i> if for all
        $x,y \in C$ and for all
        $\alpha \in [0,1]$ the point
        $\alpha x + (1-\alpha) y \in C$.
    </div>

    <h2>A Story Excerpt</h2>

    <p>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole,
    filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy
    hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and
    that means comfort.</p>

    <p>It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny
    yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube- shaped
    hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled
    walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots
    and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. The
    tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of
    the hill— The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it— and
    many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on
    another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars,
    pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes),
    kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same
    passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these
    were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his
    garden, and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.</p>

    <p>This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The
    Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind,
    and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them
    were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything
    unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without
    the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure,
    and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have
    lost the neighbours’ respect, but he gained—well, you will see whether he
    gained anything in the end.</p>
